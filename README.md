# file-sharing-nodejs
- [ ] express file sharing checking for duplicates (must be checked before post)
	- [ ] client can check the name but the same file with different name can exist so the client can do hashing  (time consuming)
- [ ] express file sharing folder structure
	- [ ] now include path in the name of the files and based on the path the frontend can structure the folder
## future works
- [ ] no need to upload from the host since the file is there in the system
- [ ] use streams
